# Client_Server_RMI
This project involves creating and implementing an RMI (Remote Method Invocation) server that offers two functions: PGCD and PPCM. Additionally, a client is developed to consume these functionalities remotely.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two folders:

1. **Server Implementation**: Contains the server-side code with the implementation of the PGCD and PPCM functions.

2. **Client**: Contains the client-side code that interacts with the server. The client utilizes a menu to execute the methods provided by the server. An additional option 'Quit' is included in the menu, allowing users to exit the infinite loop and view the executed actions' history.

## Server Functions

The server provides the following functions:

1. **PGCD Calculation**: Calculates the Greatest Common Divisor.
2. **PPCM Calculation**: Calculates the Least Common Multiple.

## Client Interaction

The client utilizes a menu for interacting with the server. The menu includes options for executing the PGCD and PPCM methods remotely. There is also an option to quit the loop and display the history of executed actions.
